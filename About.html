        <h1>About Full Stack Development</h1><br>
        <img src="about.png" height="400" width="400" align="right" align="topright"><br>
        <p>ull stack development is the process of developing both the frontend and backend of applications. Any application has a frontend (user-facing) component and a backend (database and logic) component. The frontend contains the user interface and code related to user interactions with the application. The backend contains all the code required for the application to run, including integrations with data systems, communicating with other applications, and processing data.

            Software developers require slightly different skills, tools, and software knowledge for frontend and backend development. However, full-stack development combines both disciplines—meaning teams can build applications from start to finish in an integrated and cohesive manner. A full-stack application is a software application that encompasses both frontend and backend in a single code base. </p><br>
        
        <br><p>Frontend technology
            Frontend technology (or client software) focuses on the client-facing side of development. You code any parts of the graphical user interface (GUI) or the features that users interact with using frontend technology.
            
            The most common frontend languages are:
            
            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
            JavaScript
            HTML allows you to structure web pages and the content on them. You use CSS to style the content, creating more comprehensive layouts or structures. Finally, JavaScript lets you add interactive features to a webpage, creating dynamic content for users.
            
            Backend technology 
            Backend technology (or server software) coordinates the exchange of information between the frontend and the server running a webpage. It allows an application to communicate with the main server. The most common backend languages are Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP), Ruby, Java, and Python. However, there are many more programming languages and technologies that can be used for different requirements. 
            
            You can group backend technology into three sub-layers:
            
            API layer
            The API layer receives interactions from the frontend and then communicates these to the storage layer. This layer acts as a bridge between the frontend and the backend.
            
            Storage layer
            The storage layer manages and stores any application data. It will communicate with databases to write and read data, while providing access to data. A notification layer will send notifications from the frontend to the backend and vice versa. This allows an application to communicate and trigger responses.
            
            Business logic layer
            The business logic layer is the main core of the backend. Backend developers configure processing logic in this layer, changing the response a certain API request delivers.
            
            Full-stack developer skills
            You must specialize in computer science to become a full-stack developer. Full-stack developers have a high level of competency in both frontend and backend languages. They are skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Django, and PHP. Equally, full-stack developers understand various database management systems (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and more.
            
            Full-stack web development isn’t just about coding— it also requires a number of soft skills like collaboration, effective communication, planning, and more.</p>
